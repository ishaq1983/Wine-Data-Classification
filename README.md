## Binary Classification of Wine dataset using Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier

### In this we develop a binary classification model to differentiate Red Wine from White Wine using distinct data sets for both the wine types.

Firstly,  an exploratory data analysis will be performed to detect the patterns in the data set.

Secondly, binary classification models will be developed via hyperparameter tuning for Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting classifiers with the help of full feature set.

Finally, important features will be selected from the full feature set based on the correlation with the wine type, and the performance of these stripped-down binary classification models will be compared with the full-fledged classification models.

we will feature following tools/libraries to classify Wine types using 3 machine learning algorithms namely 
Support Vector Machine (SVM), 
Random Forest (RF) and 
Gradient Boost classifiers:

Python
Jupyter Notebook
scikit-learn
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
